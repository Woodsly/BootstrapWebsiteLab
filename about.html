            I was born and raised in Grosse Pointe, MI. Growing up, I was pretty much
            always on the computer if I wasn't biking around the town with my friends.
            I found a game called Runescape when I was 6 years old and instantly fell
            in love with it - I actually am still playing today. Besides gaming, I
            also enjoyed playing soccer and baseball. I ended up choosing soccer over
            baseball, and played through my sophomore year of highschool. The
            following year I made the decision to switch to cross country and ran for
            my last 2 years of highschool. I also played the saxophone and was in the
            school band for all of my years.
          </p>

            Growing up, I always knew I was going to go to Michigan State for college.
            Following highschool I was accepted into Michigan State's Human Biology
            program. I didn't know what kind of job I wanted after school, all I knew
            was that I loved biology. After talking with the guidance counselors I
            eventually found pharmacy, and that became my main focus. Following
            graduation I wanted to wait before applying to pharmacy school so I could
            get some experience in the field. Pharmacy school is a very big commitment
            and isn't cheap, so I wanted to make sure it was what I really wanted to
            do. I eventually got a job as a pharmacy technician at RiteAid and had my
            eyes opened to how terrible pharmacy really is. Working in practically any
            pharmacy is the equivalent at working at McDonald's, except when you tell
            someone their happy meal is $5, they get angry and say it should be free
            through their insurance, even though they're currently uninsured. One of
            the pharmacists I worked with said I should do something with computers.
            That was all the convincing I needed to get out of pharmacy and look for
            other options which eventually lead me here, to Grand Circus.
